# REST_with_Udemy
Udemy's REST API's with Flash and Python course notes by Jose Salvatierra

NOTE: These scripts are NOT written by me.

I needed to learn how to make a REST for a different project so I took a Udemy course and used a different website
to learn how to do it.

I am uploading these scripts because they contain my notes and I also used this knowledge to make my own REST API
